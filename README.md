# Hydrogen Optimization using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Project Description
This project aims to optimize the hydrogen production rate in an electrolysis system using linear regression. The model incorporates an empirical equation to ensure compliance with a power constraint (current * voltage < 15 W). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and practical recommendations for system optimization.
