# Hydrogen Optimization using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## Project Description
This project aims to optimize the hydrogen production rate in an electrolysis system using linear regression. The model incorporates an empirical equation to ensure compliance with a power constraint (current * voltage < 15 W). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and practical recommendations for system optimization.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and optimization.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hydrogen-Optimization-ML.git
cd Hydrogen-Optimization-ML
pip install -r requirements.txt
