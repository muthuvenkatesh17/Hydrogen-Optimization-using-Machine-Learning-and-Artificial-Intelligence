# Hydrogen Production Rate Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to optimize the hydrogen production process by predicting the Hydrogen Production Rate (HPR) based on varying Voltage and Current values. Efficient hydrogen production is crucial for applications in energy storage and fuel cells. By finding the optimal combination of Voltage and Current, we can maximize the hydrogen output, thus improving the efficiency of the production process. This project employs machine learning models to achieve this goal.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective is to identify the optimal combination of Voltage and Current that maximizes the Hydrogen Production Rate (HPR). This involves using machine learning techniques to predict HPR based on the input variables (Voltage and Current) and determining the most effective settings for hydrogen production.
